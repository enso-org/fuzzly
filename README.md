# Fuzzly

Fuzzly is a lightning-quick engine for performing fuzzy text searches. We use it
in [Luna Studio](https://github.com/luna/luna-studio/) as part of the function
searcher, but it is far more broadly applicable.

Feel free submit an [issue](https://github.com/luna/fuzzly/issues/new/choose) if
you have any problems!
